# Udacity-Projekt1
This GitHub repository contains an analysis of global AirBnb property data from the year 2017. 
The data set is from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/airbnb.

## Getting Started
For a general overview of the data, start with look_into_data.ipynb. For a detailed data analysis, including correlation analysis, use eval_airbnb_global.ipynb.
Some steps for data cleaning in the eval are only explained by the results in look_into_data in order to keep the evaluation as concise as possible.

## Data
The data includes information about properties from different properties worldwide. The dataset contains, among other things, the following data:

Country: The country where the property is located.
City: The city where the property is located.
Price: The price of the property in the respective currency of the country.
Area: The area of the property in square meters.
Rooms: The number of rooms in the property.
Host Location: Host information to his/her location

The data is stored in a CSV file named "airbnb-listings.csv".
